TM-Link is a newly available trade mark database developed in collaboration between IP Australia, Swinburne University
and Melbourne University. TM-Link includes administrative data from jurisdictions across the world, linked at the application
level by advanced neural network algorithms. We are encouraging hackers to explore this new data set and consider what creative
visualisations, innovative insights and/or opportunities to further enrich the data they might imagine. 

TM-Link is an internationally linked dataset that combines trade mark administrative data from IP Australia, Canadian Intellectual Property Office (CIPO), European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO), United Kingdom Intellectual Property Office (UKIPO), and the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). TM-Link uses innovative neural network algorithms developed by Swinburne University to link trade mark applications between jurisdictions, enabling insights that were never before possible. TM-Link was released to the public
on www.data.gov.au as a Beta in April, and forms a critical part of IP Australiaâ€™s forward work program in its data strategy. IP Australia is looking for creative ways of visualising the dataset and/or creating interfaces that showcase the value of  TM-Link and how it can be used.
